== Welcome to Cemosis documentation! 

{cemosis} is the technological platform in mathematics of University of Strasbourg.
{Cemosis} aims at fostering collaborations between mathematicians and enterprises as well as other disciplines.
Here you will find the documentation of some {cemosis} projects in different applications domains: environment, health and physics.

=== Expertise

{cemosis} expertise is in 

* [x] modeling simulation and control
* [x] data analysis, big data, IA
* [x] high performance computing
* [x] signal and image processing

=== National and International Relations

In France, we work closely with {amies}, the national agency for mathematics in interaction with enterprises and society.

In Europe, we are part of the {eumathsin} network.
It is a new initiative to boost mathematics for industry in Europe
